h5wrapper
=========

The package `h5wrapper` provides class that wrap additional functionality around the `h5py` package, thus HDF5 files.

Wrapper files enhances the usability of HDF5files by

  simplifying the interaction using natural naming, interactive and clean content repesentation and the usage of
  xarray classes instead of numpy arrays

and by

  introduction of meta data conventions such as `standard_names`, `long_names` and layout definitions.

All above enhances the FAIRness (FAIR=Findable+Accessible+Interoperable+re-usable) of HDF5 files.
