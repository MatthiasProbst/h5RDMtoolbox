    "# Layouts\n",
    "\n",
    "A Layout in the context of this package describes the required tree-structure and multiple meta information of an HDF5 file. What and how exactly can be defined via a layout is outlined in [a later section.](#Write-an-individual-layout)\n",
    "\n",
    "A layout essentially is a HDF itself and is used in combination with a another HDF5 file, e.g. one that contains measurement data. Specialized \"wrapper-HDF files\" in this package such as `H5File` or `H5PIV` come already with a pre-defined layout, which is already associated with it\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind defining layouts is, that the data generation process is supervised. This means, that a *check* can be performed by the user filling the HDF5 file with data using the provided layout file. This in turn will lead to no suprises or inconsitencies when exchanging the file with other as everybody involved agreed on the respected layout. Optimally, this will save a lot of tie and costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two way to work with layouts:\n",
    "1. Via raw python\n",
    "2. Via the shell\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the shell is recommended for quick checks and to get an overview. Let's first do that and find out which layouts are already provided by the package:"
