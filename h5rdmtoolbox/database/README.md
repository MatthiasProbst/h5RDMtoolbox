## Installation notes to use mongoDB

Tested with mongo DB version 6.0.0

### I don't have a Mongo DB Server running ....

If you need to setup your own (local or network) server and have not yet installed the Mongo DB Community Server,
download it [here](
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows-unattended/
)

**Recommendation**: Don't configure MongoDB as a "Windows service", thus uncheck the "Install MongoD as a Service". Then
follow the [instructions](
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows-unattended/#start-mongodb-community-edition-from-the-command-interpreter)
